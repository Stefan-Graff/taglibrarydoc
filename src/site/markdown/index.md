Tag Library Documentation Generator is a utility for automatically generating
javadoc-style documentation for JavaServer Pages&trade; (JSP&trade;) Technology
Tag Libraries. It accepts a set of tag libraries as input, and generates a set
of HTML files as output. It can also be used to generate tag library
documentation for JavaServer Faces UI components.

Included in the output is a full description of each defined tag library, the
tags contained within those tag libraries, and how to use those tags.
